Specifically, we examined and selected binomial deviance model from scry to calculate the per-gene ranks and deviance difference with and without batch variable. Then, we derived data-driven threshold approach based on the number of standard deviation (nSD) in relative change of deviance and in rank difference to identify the biased features. Finally, we validated the clustering performances of computational method by PRECAST.\n\nR/biasDetect | Identify the biased features from spatially variable genes in spatially-resolved transcriptomics data and from highly variable genes in single-nucleus RNA sequencing data with batch variable."

There are plentiful datasets generated by more than 20 assays from various donors and samples. Despite these data resources being available on HuBMAP Data Portal, there currently lacks programmatic interface in R to access, explore, retrieve, and download these data. Thus, I developed and published efficient and programmatic R client named HuBMAPR with Bioconductor framework. As an R/Bioconductor package, HuBMAPR successfully helps worldwide researchers to conduct data retrieval and bulk data transfer from HuBMAP Data Portal easier and faster. On December 2nd, I was invited to present HuBMAPR 10-minute package demo oral presentation.\n\nHou C, Ghazanfar S, Marini F, Morgan M, Hicks SC. (2024).

There is less information about how farm exposures relate to respiratory illnesses and mucosal immune development. As undergraduate research assistant, I helped to remove samples that failed quality control checks or did not have corresponding respiratory illness data of the 100 samples submitted for sequencing (22 farm and 42 non-farm samples were included in the analyses of differential gene expression). I performed differential expression analysis using DESeq2 and applied gene set enrichment analysis to compare the gene expression trends for farm status and high repository illness count. I also utilized Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis (WGCNA) results to identify co-expressed gene modules in the transcriptomics data and quantified the eigen-genes for each module and explored differential expression to determine whether any modules were associated with farm status or respiratory illness frequency.\n\nBrownell J, Lee KE, Chasman D, Gangnon R, Bendixsen CG, Barnes K, Grindle K, Pappas T, Bochkov YA, Dresen A, Hou C, Haslam DB, Seroogy CM, Ong IM, Gern JE.
